# jz-build
Here is a template for starting a new project with sass.
*IMPORTANT* Be sure to install sass globally on your machine before using this build. 

Step 1: Open your Terminal or Command Prompt. On the Mac the Terminal.app comes installed by default. It's located in your "Utilities" folder. Use cmd + spacebar and type 'terminal', enter to open.

Step 2: In terminal window type 'gem install sass' if you get a permissions error press ctrl+c and type in 'sudo gem install sass'.

Step 3: To ensure sass is installed in terminal type in 'sass -v'. This will show you the version number and name of the current sass.

Step 4: Download or Clone this repo to your computer. To clone repo do the following:
  
  -In terminal navigate to a destination folder 'cd Documents' (for example). Then type in 'git clone (paste the web adress for the repo here)' then hit enter. Once comlete jz-build will be locally stored on your machine. You can now rename jz-build if you'd like.
  
Step 5: Using your favorite code editor open the site template. In terminal navigate to your new site folder 'cd Documents/jz-build' and then type in 'sass --watch sass:css'. This will begin trolling the folder to find any sass styles and convert them to css.

Step 6: You are ready to begin your new project!
